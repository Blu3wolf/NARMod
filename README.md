# NARMod 4
NARMod modding

Version: NARMod requires Factorio version 0.12.3.
Short Description: NARMod is a mod that overhauls the contruction and crafting aspects of the game. Enemies and combat are not altered in any way.

Long Description: NARMod is a mod for Factorio that aims to be a standalone mod to create a great Factorio experience for the experienced player.
Its target audience is those players who feel they have fully experienced vanilla Factorio and are craving to have the challenge and complexity of the game increased from the building/crafting side.
NARMod is enormously complex... probably roughly a three or four-fold increase in complexity from the vanilla experience.
It is not for everyone.
NARMod is unlikely to be compatable with other mods, except perhaps ones that only affect combat / enemies.

Notes:This version is NARMod 4, with Treefarm, Dytech and Bob's Mods stripped out and added as dependencies.
